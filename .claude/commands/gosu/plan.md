# Comprehensive Feature Planning Command

Perform comprehensive feature planning as an expert software architect and project manager. Analyze the current codebase, understand project patterns, and create detailed implementation plans with multi-phase task breakdown.

## Command Usage

```bash
claude gosu:plan [feature_description]
```

**Feature Description:** $ARGUMENTS

**Examples:**
```bash
claude gosu:plan "user profile management with avatar upload and privacy settings"
claude gosu:plan "real-time chat system with message history and file sharing"
claude gosu:plan "advanced search functionality with filters and autocomplete"
claude gosu:plan
```

**Note:** If no feature description is provided, the command will prompt for feature requirements interactively.

## Phase 1: Technology Stack Detection & Codebase Analysis

**CRITICAL**: Before planning any feature, automatically detect and analyze the technology stack:

### Technology Stack Detection
Use the Task tool to identify:
- **Programming Languages**: Scan file extensions (.js, .ts, .py, .java, .cs, .go, .rb, .php, .kt, .swift, etc.)
- **Frameworks**: Identify by package files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, Cargo.toml, composer.json, etc.)
- **Web Frameworks**: Express, NestJS, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, Rails, Laravel, ASP.NET, Gin, etc.
- **Database Technologies**: SQL/NoSQL databases, ORMs, migration tools, connection libraries
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Maven, Gradle, npm/yarn, pip, cargo, dotnet, etc.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Mocha, pytest, JUnit, NUnit, RSpec, PHPUnit, etc.
- **Package Managers**: npm, yarn, pip, maven, gradle, composer, cargo, nuget, etc.

### Adaptive Project Understanding

if [ -z "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then
  echo "🎯 Feature Planning Session"
  echo ""
  echo "Please describe the feature you want to plan and implement:"
  echo "- What functionality should it provide?"
  echo "- Who are the intended users?"
  echo "- Any specific requirements or constraints?"
  echo ""
  echo "Example: 'user profile management with avatar upload and privacy settings'"
  echo ""
  read -p "Feature Description: " FEATURE_DESC
else
  FEATURE_DESC="$ARGUMENTS"
  echo "🎯 Planning Feature: $FEATURE_DESC"
fi
```

### Deep Feature Understanding

```bash
# Check if .gosu directory exists, if not, skip file creation
if [ -d ".gosu" ]; then
  TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
  PLAN_FILE=".gosu/plan-${TIMESTAMP}.md"
  
  # Save the complete plan to file for persistent memory
  cat > "$PLAN_FILE" << 'EOF'
# Feature Implementation Plan - [Feature Name]

**Created:** $(date)
**Status:** Planning Complete - Awaiting User Approval
**File ID:** plan-${TIMESTAMP}

### Plan Refinement Handling

If user chooses "Modify Plan", update the saved plan file:

# Update plan file with refinements
if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
  cp "$PLAN_FILE" "${PLAN_FILE}.backup"
  # Update the plan content based on user feedback
  # Add refinement log
  echo "\n## Plan Refinements\n- Refined: $(date) - [Refinement details]" >> "$PLAN_FILE"
fi
```

If user chooses "Cancel Plan", delete the plan file:
```bash
# Cancel plan and clean up file
if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
  echo "🗑️ Canceling plan and deleting file: $PLAN_FILE"
  rm "$PLAN_FILE"
  echo "❌ Plan canceled and file deleted"
fi
```

### User Confirmation & Implementation Options

**CRITICAL**: Always stop and ask for user approval before proceeding with implementation.

```
FEATURE PLANNING COMPLETE

Feature: [Feature Name]
Complexity: [High/Medium/Low]
Estimated Implementation: [X phases, Y tasks]
Plan File: .gosu/plan-[TIMESTAMP].md (if .gosu directory exists)

Planning Summary:
" Phase 1: [X] foundation tasks (database, core models)
" Phase 2: [X] core feature tasks (API, business logic)  
" Phase 3: [X] integration tasks (auth, file handling)
" Phase 4: [X] testing and documentation tasks

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this feature plan?

Options:
1. Yes - Follow the saved plan and begin implementing Phase 1 (P0 tasks)
2. No - Stop here, planning only (plan saved for later use with gosu:work)
3. Selective - Let me choose which phases/tasks to implement
4. Modify Plan - Adjust the plan and update the saved file
5. Cancel Plan - Delete the plan file and stop
```

## Phase 6: Multi-Agent Implementation Strategy (Only if User Confirms)

### Implementation Complexity Analysis
When user approves implementation, determine optimal execution strategy:

#### Multi-Agent Feasibility Assessment
**Evaluate if multiple agents should be used based on:**
- **Task Count**: >12 implementation tasks across different areas
- **Component Distribution**: Tasks span >6 different modules or areas
- **Skill Diversity**: Mix of database, API, testing, and integration work
- **Task Independence**: Implementation tasks can be completed independently
- **Complexity Variation**: Mix of simple configuration and complex business logic

#### Agent Assignment Strategy
**If Multi-Agent is Feasible:**
- **Agent 1 (Database & Models)**: Database migrations, entities, data models
- **Agent 2 (API & Services)**: Controllers, services, business logic implementation
- **Agent 3 (Integration & Security)**: Authentication, file handling, third-party integrations
- **Agent 4 (Testing & Documentation)**: Unit tests, integration tests, API documentation

**If Single Agent is Optimal:**
- Complex interdependent feature requiring coordinated implementation
- Small feature with <8 implementation tasks
- Feature requiring careful orchestration across multiple existing modules
- High risk of conflicts between concurrent implementations

### Implementation Execution with Plan Tracking

**IMPORTANT**: If implementing, always reference and update the saved plan file to track progress.

```bash
# Update plan file with implementation start
if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
  sed -i 's/Status: Planning Complete - Awaiting User Approval/Status: Implementation In Progress/' "$PLAN_FILE"
  echo "\n## Implementation Log\n- Started: $(date)" >> "$PLAN_FILE"
fi
```

#### Multi-Agent Coordination (If Determined Feasible)
```
DEPLOYING MULTI-AGENT FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION TEAM

Feature: [Feature Name]
Agent Distribution:
- Agent 1: [X] Database/Model tasks in migrations/, entities/
- Agent 2: [X] API/Service tasks in controllers/, services/
- Agent 3: [X] Integration tasks in auth/, middleware/, config/
- Agent 4: [X] Testing/Docs tasks in test/, docs/

Each agent will receive:
- Specific task assignments from the implementation plan
- Complete feature context and requirements
- Current codebase patterns and conventions
- Coordination guidelines to prevent conflicts
```

#### Single Agent Implementation (If Multi-Agent Not Feasible)
Create prioritized todo list and proceed with sequential implementation following the saved plan.

**Task Completion Tracking**: After completing each task, update the plan file:
```bash
# Mark completed tasks in plan file
sed -i 's/- \[ \] Task X: Description/- \[x\] Task X: Description - Completed: $(date)/' "$PLAN_FILE"
echo "- Completed Task X: [Description] at $(date)" >> "$PLAN_FILE"
```

### Implementation Verification & Summary
Once implementation is complete:

```
FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Feature: [Feature Name]
Implementation Summary:
- Phase 1 (Database): [X] migrations, [X] entities created
- Phase 2 (API): [X] endpoints, [X] services implemented
- Phase 3 (Integration): [X] auth integration, [X] file handling
- Phase 4 (Testing): [X] unit tests, [X] integration tests

Total Implementation: [X] tasks completed
Code Quality: Maintains project standards
Test Coverage: [X]% coverage added
Documentation: Updated API docs and README
```

**File Cleanup**: After successful implementation completion:
```bash
# Mark plan as completed and clean up
if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
  echo "🗑️ Cleaning up completed plan file: $PLAN_FILE"
  rm "$PLAN_FILE"
  echo "✅ Plan file deleted - implementation complete"
fi
```
